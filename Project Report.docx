Bonus Points
Candidates are encouraged to use their creativity to build a more interesting or production-ready version of Hangman, some features could include:
1. Deploy your project into any cloud provider and make it public accessible. [TODO: add recommendations, some hosting may not be free]
2. Make the project support i18n and / or a11y.
3. Make your application more robust by adding tests, including: unit test, integration test, and end to end tests.
4. Build a bot / application to auto play this game.
5. Build a server to record more information, e.g. leader board. (node.js or server side is not covered in this course, but you can feel free to discuss with your peers or consult the trainers).
6. Make it a multiplayer game, e.g. two players can play the same game and decide a winner; have a matching mechanism; make it an online party game, etc.

We are not strict with the bonus points, but we will select one project for each category below:
1. Most popular one (voted by trainers)
2. Most Technical Challenging
3. Best User Experience
